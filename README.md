# µcast

µcast (Unix name `ucast` starts with the Roman letter "u") is a
toolkit for micro-weather forecast for astronomy.
It provides a high-level and developer-friendly interface to combine
weather data and forecast models to enable accurate micro-weather
forecast at telescope sites.

## Backends

µcast supports multiple atmospherical model backends.

### *am*

[*am*](https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~spaine/am) is a tool for radiative
transfer computations at microwave to submillimeter wavelengths.
It is the default model for radio astronomy.
